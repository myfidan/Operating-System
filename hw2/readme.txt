For running programs in spim;
-Change syscall.h and syscall.cpp files with my syscall.h and syscall.cpp files
Then move SPIMOS_GTU_1.s and SPIMOS_GTU_2.s files to spim document. After that you can type make for build spim and you can run program 1 as:
./spim -f SPIMOS_GTU_1.s

program 2:
./spim -f SPIMOS_GTU_2.s
